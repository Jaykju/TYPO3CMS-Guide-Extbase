=============================
f:be.security.ifAuthenticated
=============================

This ViewHelper checks to see whether the current page visitor (backend user)
is authenticated or not. According to the result of the check, the content of
the subsidiary `f:then` or `f:else` ViewHelper will be parsed.

This feature is predominantly used in the front end of the website: you can
check whether the website visitor is currently authenticated as a backend user.
A good example of a possible use case is for a front end editing tool, which
should only be made available to a validated, logged-in backend user.

Properties
==========

This ViewHelper doesn't accept any properties.
